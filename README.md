# REDatlas: Mapping the Global Distribution of Repeat Expansion Disorders

**REDatlas** is an interactive resource that visualizes the **geographic distribution** of **Repeat Expansion Disorders (REDs)** worldwide. This tool aggregates reported cases from the literature, links each disorder to relevant clinical and genomic resources, and displays population-level patterns through a user-friendly map interface.

Explore:
- Geographic regions where REDs have been reported
- Disorder-specific repeat length thresholds from the literature
- Integrated links to [GeneReviews](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/) and [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/)
- A Streamlit-based map interface for visual exploration
